Hey too whoever is reading this. My name is charlie as you probably already know. I have a very big intrest in science and electronics, so i thought "why not combine them". 
One of my main intrests in science is Nuclear Physics.
One of the cooler things involved in nuclear physics is all the radiation emited from it. 
I thought "well how does one measure this radiation?"
Behold the migthy "GEIGER COUNTER!"

Ive had the idea of building a geigercounter for a while, but i never really followed through with it. i made a silly prototype that never worked that well. 
Now that the Hack Club has made a "competition" i got a boost of motivation wich has led me to follow through with it. 
If you are intersted in making one of these feel free to copy, and most of all feel free to ask questions. I Love Questions.
